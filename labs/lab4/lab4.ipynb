    "## Now we start the main part of the lab\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation\n",
    "We often want to resize images (say, for different screen sizes/resolutions). A standard solution to make an image smaller would be to just discard some of the pixels. For example, if we want to make the image exactly half its original width and height, we can cut up the images into $2\\times 2$ squares and just keep the upper-left pixel in each square. But what if you want to reduce the size of the image by 30%? Or, what if you want to change the aspect ratio of the image without stretching the image contents? Now things get more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will explore a technique called _seam carving_. If you are interested, you can check out the 2007 paper by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir [_Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing_](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ariel-Shamir/publication/215721610_Seam_Carving_for_Content-Aware_Image_Resizing/links/55f7b1ce08aec948c472947e/Seam-Carving-for-Content-Aware-Image-Resizing.pdf). As the title of the paper suggests, this algorithm is about \"content-aware\" image resizing, which means that the pixels we add/remove are chosen based on the content itself. With seam carving, we can resize to any size, not just nice fractions like double or half. You may find this 5-minute video about Seam Carving helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc\n",
    " \n",
    "Note: in this lab we will consider only the problem of making an image smaller. Seam carving can also be used to make an image larger but we skip that here in the interest of time. "

    "##### What's the basic idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "Seam carving works by removing _seams_, one at a time. What is a seam? A _vertical seam_ is a connected path from the top to the bottom of the image, where the seam contains one pixel in each row. Similarly, a _horizontal seam_ is a connected path from the left to the right of the image, where the seam contains one pixel in each column. The image below shows a vertical seam and a horizontal seam, both in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, when we say a \"connected\" path, what do we mean by connected? Definition: a connected vertical (horizontal) path is a sequence of pixels, one per row (column), such that each pair of adjacent pixels is at most one column (row) apart. In other words, as you move down the image to create a vertical seam, you can only move diagonally or straight down; you can't move to a pixel that is further away.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.ulfdittmer.com/imagej/imret-Im1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Seam carving works by repeatedly removing (or adding) seams until the desired size is achieved. You do not need to worry about this part: you are  provided with the function `seam_carve` that takes in an image and a desired size, and finds/removes the seams until the desired size is reached. You are only responsible for writing function `find_vertical_seam`. This is the interesting part."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### How do we assess the quality of a seam? \n",
    "Seam carving works by defining an _energy function_, which is a proxy for how important each pixel is. You do not need to  understand how energy is computed (it should make more sense in a few months, after DSCI 572). Instead, we provide you with a function `energy` that takes in an image and returns an array of the same size containing the energy values. For those who are interested in what makes a good energy function, you can refer to the original paper (the basic idea is that when pixel intensities vary more rapidly, this indicates a more important part of the image, and thus higher energy). Next, assuming you have the energy image in hand, a vertical or horizontal seam is simply the minimum energy connected dpath from top to bottom, or left to right, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the three parts below, you will consider a few different methods for finding the best seam out of all possible seams. You will discover that there are many ways of solving the same problem, and some are much better than others!"

The only modification we're making is overwriting the `find_vertical_seam` function with a new version. All the other functions are carried over from the original `SeamCarve` class.

The next step is to optimize the implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm. A typical approach would be to ditch Python; while R might not be much faster (maybe it's slower?), other languages like C or perhaps Julia would speed things up. Another approach would be to use parallel computing, in which multiple threads of computation are performed at once. However, changing languages and parallelization are not always the only way. In Part 3, we implemented your forward pass with a nested `for` loop over the rows and columns of the image. However, certain languages (Python/NumPy, R, Matlab, etc.) do _vectorized_ operations much faster than loops."
